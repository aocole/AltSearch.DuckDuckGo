###DuckDuckGo Alternate Search.

*Often I find myself having to Copy/Paste my original search into sites like Google whenever DuckDuckGo doesn't successfully deliver valid search results. This Chrome Extension solves that by injecting the search links into the side bar for me.*

Find the official plugin in the [Chrome Store][1]
